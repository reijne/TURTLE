This directory contains 3 example codes.  They are
geneig2.c wilk2.c and tri_test.c.

The files geneig2.c wilk2.c and tri_test.c are examples of using C calling
the C version of the PeIGS library.

The user should beware that the definition for CTOFLIB in the DEFS files in the
peigs directory is important here for building the C examples.
Unfortunately, the MXSUBS on the SUN seems to need a F77 driver program
to perserve the common block.


This directory also contains the file teslamach for generating
machine dependent parameters which must be included in
 .../peigs/h/blas_lapack.h
