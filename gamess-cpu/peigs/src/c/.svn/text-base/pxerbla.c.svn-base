    This routine performs an
    element by element comparision of a length n array of characters on
    a processor with its neighbor as described by a list of processors
    map[0:len-1].
    
    It is assumed that values in the array map[0:len-1] form
    the same set of processors (User Beware); for this routine, the
    ordering in map[0:len-1] is not important.  if the array[0:n-1] on
    each of the processors in map[0:len-1] does not match pxerbal1_
    returns

    *info > 0:  array on this processor is different from "array" on
                one of this processor's neighbor.  *info != 0 on one
                processor does not mean that *info != 0 on all processors
                in procmap.  To do this you need to do a global operation.
                This is typically by g_exit_().
