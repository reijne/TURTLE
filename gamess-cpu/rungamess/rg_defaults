#
#  DO NOT EDIT
#  If you edit rg_site_defaults you risk losing your changes
#  when configure is next run.
#
#  You can over-ride these automatically chosen choices by 
#  adding definitions at the end of the rg_site_defaults.in
#  file, or by setting the environment variables yourself
#  before running rungamess.
