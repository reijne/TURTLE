Running the Parallel MPI/ScaLAPACK-based Examples and Validation tests
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory, parallel_MPI/test_jobs, is designed to be part of the
mechanism for running the validation and benchmark jobs associated with
the MPI/ScaLAPACK/BLACS-based parallel GAMESS-UK code.  The overall
directory structure for GAMESS-UK depicting the various components is
shown below:

/test_jobs contains the vtab file for the runs on all machines.
	   The sub-directories under test_jobs characterise the
	   machine under test. These will only hold scripts to run
	   the validation jobs, and eventually O/P files from the
	   completed tests.

Thus to test and validate the code on a given machine, simply head for
the appropriate /machine directory [where machine = hpcx, origin, altix
etc] and run the example scripts and validation tests provided, as
described in the README. it is assumed that if the machine in question
is not provided as part of the distribution version of the code, then
creating such a directory and its contents should be straightforward
based on the examples that are provided.
