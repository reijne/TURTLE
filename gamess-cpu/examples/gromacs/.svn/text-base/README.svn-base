README GROMACS/GAMESS-UK
========================

This example demonstrates the use of GAMESS-UK through GROMACS. The example is
the Linear Transit Tutorial example by Gerrit Groenhof entitled "QM/MM 
calculations on a Diels-Alder antibody catalyst" (see 
http://www.dddc.ac.cn/embo04/practicals/qmmm/qmmmvacuum.html [13 Aug 2009]).

The tutorial has been adapted in that it now uses GAMESS-UK instead of MOPAC
as the quantum engine, and a script run_gromacs.sh has been provided to run
the calculations. Also everything has been set up to run the calculations and
all the input generation steps have been removed. See the original tutorial
to learn about setting GROMACS calculations up.

Please note that this example is purely for the purpose of demonstrating 
the GROMACS/GAMESS-UK capability. Due to the changes made to the example no
guarantees can be given for the scientific content of this example.

To run this example make sure you set the environment variable GROMACS_DIR
so that the script can find the GROMACS programs grompp and mdrun, then
simply enter:

        ./run_gromacs.sh

As the example performs several geometry optimisations it may take a while
to run.
