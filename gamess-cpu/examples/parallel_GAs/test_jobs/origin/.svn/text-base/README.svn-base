Validating Jobs on the SGI Origin 3800
======================================

This directory is to be used for running all the jobs required to
validate the parallel GA-based GAMESS-UK code. It is anticipated that
LSF is in use, with all jobs submitted using "bsub". and that each job
will require no more than 32 processors, in most cases 8 or 16 will
suffice.

A number of scripts that tackle all the validation runs are included.
Taking one specific examples, the following script, script_validate.cyclo: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
#BSUB -n 32
#BSUB -W 60
#BSUB -o validate.o%J
#BSUB -e validate.e%J
#BSUB -J validate

cd /cxfs/HOME2/teras/gamess/MFG/GAMESS-UK/examples/parallel_GAs/test_jobs/origin

rm -rf /scratch/local/gamess/validate
mkdir /scratch/local/gamess/validate
 
cp /cxfs/HOME2/teras/gamess/MFG/GAMESS-UK/bin/gamess-uk /scratch/local/gamess/validate

cp ../../input_files/DFT.cyclo.6-31G.in /scratch/local/gamess/validate
 
cd /scratch/local/gamess/validate

mpirun -np 32 gamess-uk < DFT.cyclo.6-31G.in > /cxfs/HOME2/teras/gamess/MFG/GAMESS-UK/examples/parallel_GAs/test_jobs/origin/DFT.cyclo.6-31G.out
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

submitted by simply issuing "bsub < bsub.cyclo", mpirun will be used in
running the sample input data in

            examples/parallel_GAs/input_files/DFT.cyclo.6-31G.in 

and routing the O/P to the present directory in the file
DFT.cyclo.6-31G.out. Note that in the current setup all jobs are
actually run on the scratch partition, and not in the GAMESS-UK
directory itself.

Other scripts in this directory will run a number of mpirun's to
process the following list of data files that are required to validate
the code. e.g.  script_validate.32.HF, script_validate.64.DFT,
script_validate.64.MP2+SECD

The successful validation can be captured by running the interrogation
script, val_parallel, interactively to examine the O/Ps from the
parallel jobs.

The complete list of input files to be processed is as follows:

     HF.crno4.in
     HF_2e.crno4.in
     ROHF.pyridine.in
     ROHF_incore.pyridine.in
