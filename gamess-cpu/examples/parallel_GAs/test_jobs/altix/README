Validating Jobs on the SGI Altix 3700
=====================================

This directory is to be used for running all the jobs required to
validate the parallel GA-based GAMESS-UK code. It is anticipated that
LSF is in use, with all jobs submitted using "bsub", and that each job
will require no more than 32 processors, in most cases 8 or 16 will
suffice. The script files refer to usage on the SGI Altix 3700 at the
CSAR service in Manchester.

A number of scripts that tackle all the validation runs are included.
Taking one specific examples, the following script, script_validate.cyclo: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
#BSUB -n 32
#BSUB -W 30
#BSUB -o validate.o%J
#BSUB -e validate.e%J
#BSUB -J validate

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/modules/intel/mkl721/lib/64:/opt/modules/cmplrs/intel/8.1.023/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export MPI_DSM_DISTRIBUTE=1
export MPI_GROUP_MAX=1024

cd /m/dlwab/release-7-0/GAMESS-UK/examples/parallel_GAs/test_jobs/altix 

rm -rf /santmp/dlwab/validate
mkdir /santmp/dlwab/validate

cp /m/dlwab/release-7-0/GAMESS-UK/bin/gamess-uk /santmp/dlwab/validate

cp ../../input_files/DFT.cyclo.6-31G.in /santmp/dlwab/validate
 
cd /santmp/dlwab/validate

pam -mpi -auto_place ./gamess-uk < DFT.cyclo.6-31G.in > /m/dlwab/release-7-0/GAMESS-UK/examples/parallel_GAs/test_jobs/altix/DFT.cyclo.6-31G.out
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

submitted by simply issuing "bsub < script_validate.cyclo", "pam" will
be used in running the sample input data in

            examples/parallel_GAs/input_files/DFT.cyclo.6-31G.in 

and routing the O/P to the present directory in the file
DFT.cyclo.6-31G.out. Note that in the current setup all jobs are
actually run on the scratch partition, and not in the GAMESS-UK
directory itself.

Other scripts in this directory will issue a number of pam runs
to process the following list of data files that are required to
validate the code. e.g.  script_validate.HF, script_validate.DFT,
script_validate.MP2+SECD and script_validate.CI

The successful validation can be captured by running the interrogation
script, val_parallel, interactively to examine the O/Ps from the
parallel jobs.

The complete list of input files to be processed is as follows:

     HF.crno4.in
     HF_2e.crno4.in
     ROHF.pyridine.in
     ROHF_incore.pyridine.in 
     ROHF_opt.pyridine.in 
     UHF.morphine.6-31G-d.in 
     UHF_incore.pyridine.in 
     UHF_opt.pyridine.in 
     HF.Bz_crco3.TZVP.in
     ROHF.Bz_crco3.TZVP.in
     ECP_opt.crno4.in
     DFT.morphine.6-31G-dp.in 
     DFT.morphine.6-31G-dp_harmonic

     UKS.pyridine.in 
     DFT.siosi4.617.in
