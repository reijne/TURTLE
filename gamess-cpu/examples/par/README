                     ========================================

  Due to the variability in the way GAMESS-UK is invoked on the different parallel 
machines the test cases are not stored as executable scripts (as in the other
example, but as bare input files.

  par_*.in :    Input files

  par_*.out :   Output files

  run_par:      Master script which may be modified to reflect the characteristics of 
                the parallel machine.
          
  *_inter:      Scripts to run a single job interactively, to be invoked from run_par.

  *_submit:     Scripts to submit a single job to a batch queue, to be invoked from
                run_par

  val_par       Validation script.

  par.vtab:     Reference data to be used by val_par
