c
c     A common block to pass the actual time periods around in the
c     response theory code. This is needed because in subroutine 
c     such as rpmuld and rpbody the time periods that are used 
c     should be different for RPA and TDA calculations. Hence the
c     usual parameters cannot be used directly.
