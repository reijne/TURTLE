c     This common block is to be used by the routines
c        gmem_null_blockdata
c        gmem_null_initialise
c        igmem_null
c        gmem_null_finalise
c     only. It holds the index in the main floating point array

c     arguments when they are not being used. It needs to be converted
c     for use with integer arrays.
