  version 3.0   November 15th, 1999:
              * This is the most significant update of the GA package to date: 
                all source code for the core functionality of the library 
                has been rewritten, ~90% of the library code is new/changed; 
              * added support for n-dimensional arrays (n<=7);
              * added several n-dimensional test programs;
              * updated utility tools: ga_print, ga_summarize, which
                support n-dimensional operations;
              * improved interoperability with MPI on clusters of
                workstations
              * ports to Cray J90 and Windows NT (single machine)
              * ga_create uses default distribution for block size <1
                rather than <2 (the old scheme can be restored see
                OLD_DEFAULT_BLK in src/GNUmakefile)
              * added a new, easier-to-use C interface (see ntestc.c)

                compilation for particular CPU (R10000 and R8000 are
                currently recognized on the SGI systems)

                ga_dscal_patch, ga_dadd, ga_dadd_patch,
                ga_ifill_patch, ga_dfill_patch - these functions has
                been renamed to: ga_scale, ga_scale_patch, ga_add,
                ga_add_patch, ga_fill_patch;

              * new interface functions to ScaLAPACK: ga_cholesky,
                ga_llt_solve, ga_spd_invert, ga_solve
              * several configuration parameters are exposed to the
                user in global/src/config.h to allow customization of
                the package.
  version 2.1 * selection of message-passing (TCGMSG or MPI) library
              * new operations: ga_mpi_communicator and ga_proc_topology;
              * performance optimizations;
              * alternative C interface and C test programs;
              * port to Sun Solaris and PC running Linux.

              * (tightly) integrated shared and distributed memory versions;
              * ability to restrict memory usage in global arrays;
              * ga_scatter/gather supports integers;
              * a program to test performance of GA primitives;
              * different numbering of global array handles (< 0);
	      * and other internal improvements, like randomized order
