ARMCI EXAMPLES

Introduction:
  The benchmarks directory has some armci benchmarks
  
  The features directory has examples and notes on each of the features
  listed below
   1. aggregation
   2. gpc
   3. non-blocking
   4. proc_affinity
   5. concurrency
   6. notification
   7. symmetric_memory
  This is the best place to start to understand the features 

Compiling:
  The examples directory assumes armci src to be at examples/../src and
  armci libraries to be at examples/../lib/OS.
  To change where armci src is, modify the file examples_config.h
  Compiling can be done with a make command. A make in a top level 
  directory makes all sub level directories unless something is chosen 
  specifically.
  For eg. a `make` in features make all the features where as a `make gpc`
  in the features directory makes only gpc examples.

Execution:
  Any example that expects an input also has a readme in its directory 
  explaining how to use it
