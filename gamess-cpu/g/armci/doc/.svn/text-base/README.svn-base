ARMCI_NETWORK environment variable must be used to build ARMCI to
work properly on clusters with Myrinet (GM), Giganet cLAN (VIA), or
Quadrics. This is accomplished by specifying the communication protocol
appropriate for such a network. 

The recognized options for ARMCI_NETWORK are: GM, VIA, QUADRICS, SOCKETS.
SOCKETS is the assumed default for clusters connected with Ethernet.
This protocol might also work on other networks however, the performance
mght be suboptimal and on Myrinet it could even hang (GM does not
support fork that the std version of ARMCI uses).
