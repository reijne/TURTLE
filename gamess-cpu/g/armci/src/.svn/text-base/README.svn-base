There are two ARMCI tests available in this directory:
test.c - tests basic functionality
perf.c - performance benchmark for strided operations

The corresponding executable names are:
            UNIX        WINDOWS
test.c      test.x      test.exe  
perf.c      perf.x      perf.exe  

On Unix systems that support shared memory shmtest
could be used to verify how big System V shared
memory segments can be allocated. ARMCI uses that
type of memory on these systems.
