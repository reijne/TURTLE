c
c     The elements in this common block are used with the incore
c     coulomb fit approach.
c
c     ocfit_sw     : is .true. if the incore approach is to be used.
c
c     icfit_pt     : is the "pointer" to the fitting coefficient store.
c     ncfit        : is the size of the fitting coefficient store.
c
c     iite2c_stored: is the "pointer" to the 2-center Schwarz table
c     nte2c_shl    : is the size of the 2-center Schwarz table on each 
c                    node in integers.
c     iite3c_stored: is the "pointer" to the 3-center Schwarz table
c     nte3c_shl    : is the size of the 3-center Schwarz table on each
c                    node in integers.
c
c     ite2c_store  : is the "pointer" to the 2-center integral store
c     nte2c_int    : is the size of the 2-center integral store

c     nte3c_int    : is the size of the 3-center integral store
c
c     idunlap_called: counts the number of times the dunlap fitting
c                     routines have been called since the last geometry
