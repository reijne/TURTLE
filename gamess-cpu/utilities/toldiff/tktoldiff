# Tell Toldiff to a binary diff program instead of 
# the Python diff implementation. For performance
# reasons you may want to substitute the value with
# the full path of the binary diff. This saves 
# searching for the Diff program every time this script
# is run. Alternatively you may set up TOLDIFF_EXE
# in your user environment to ensure Toldiff always
# uses a binary Diff program (also when run from the
# command line).
#
export TOLDIFF_EXE=`which diff`
#
# Tell TkDiff to use a special configuration file
# containing the settings for using toldiff.
#
export TKDIFFRC="$HOME/.tktoldiffrc"
#
# Invoke TkDiff

tkdiff $1 $2
