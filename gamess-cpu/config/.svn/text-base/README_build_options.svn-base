README Build Options
====================

As described in the INSTALL_advanced.txt document during the
installation process GAMESS-UK is configured by specifying a number of
build options. Idealy all these options would be independent of
eachother but in a complex code like GAMESS-UK this cannot be achieved.
Hence there can be interference between various options and it becomes
important to know exactly what is implied when a particular option is
specified. In an attempt to keep on top of all this a list of options
in alphabetical order is given below. Each option is accompanied by 
a description of its meaning. Note that this list is not complete and
the descriptions are to some extend best guesses for options introduced
a long time ago. However, if used conscientiously this list should
help make the configuration options more reliable and predictable.

charmm
    Build GAMESS-UK as a subroutine to serve as the QM engine in CHARMm.
    Mutually exclusive with charmmpar, chemshell, taskfarm.

charmmpar
    Build GAMESS-UK as a subroutine to serve as the QM engine in the
    parallel version of CHARMm.
    Mutually exclusive with charmm, chemshell, taskfarm.

chemshell
    Build GAMESS-UK as a subroutine to serve as the QM engine in
    Chemshell. Mutually exclusive with charmm, charmmpar, taskfarm.

datain
    Build GAMESS-UK to read the input from the file "datain" in the
    current working directory rather than from standard input.

debug
    Build GAMESS-UK with the compilers debug options to obtain an
    executable that can be used with the debugger.

ga
    Build with the Global Arrays for distributed data support.
    Requires mpi, tcgmsg, or tcgmsg-mpi for message passing communiction
    support.

i4
    Build the code with 32-bit integers. 
    Mutually exclusive with i8.

i8
    Build the code with 64-bit integers.
    Mutually exclusive with i4, mpi, newscf, scalapack.

mp2_parallel
    Build the parallel MP2 gradients.
    Requires ga.

mpi
    Use MPI for message passing communications.
    Mutually exclusive with i8.

newscf
    Include the newscf driver implemented by Ian Bush.
    Mutually exclusive with i8.
    Requires in parallel scalapack.

peigs
    Include the PEiGS parallel eigensolver.
    Requires mpi, tcgmsg, or tcgmsg-mpi.

qmmm
    Build the code for QM/MM calculations which involve many centres.
    This requires some data structures to be replaced with functions
    such as tables of interatomic distances. 
    Mutually exclusive with secd_parallel.

scalapack
    Include the ScaLAPACK parallel linear algebra library.
    Mutually exclusive with i8.
    Requires mpi.

secd_parallel
    Build the parallel second derivative (Hessian) capability.
    Mutually exclusive with qmmm.
    Requires ga.

static_lb
    Use static load-balancing to distribute work over the processors.
    All processors can do useful work.

taskfarm
    Build GAMESS-UK to work within a taskfarm harness. This is an MPI
    based framework in which the total set of processors is split into
    smaller groups each of which can run independent GAMESS-UK
    calculations. 
    Mutually exclusive with charmm, charmmpar, chemshell.

tcgmsg
    Use the TCGMSG library for message passing communications.

tcgmsg-mpi
    Use the TCGMSG library implemented on top of MPI for message passing
    communications.
