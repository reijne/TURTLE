Interim instructions for testing GAMESS-UK using the new QA system
==================================================================

0. Please note

This QA system is still under development and you should not
expect it to work smoothly at this point.

1. Populating this directory

If you install a copy of the GAMESS-UK_misc directory in the
same directory as GAMESS-UK you can run the script populate.sh
in this directory. Only the QA subdirectory of GAMESS-UK_misc
is needed so you can check this out most efficiently using

cvs co GAMESS-UK_misc/QA

2. Determine which directories are to be used for this platform.

You can create the file testdirs.txt manually but the usual
procedure will be to issue 

make qa

in the GAMESS-UK/m4 directory
This will create a file testdirs.txt (from testdirs.txt.in) in
this directory, and this will contain a list of subdirectories
required to test the current build.

3. Finally, you need to choose which execution command you 
are going to use.  If rungamess is working you should not need
to change this, if not, edit the qa script to say how you want
the individual jobs to be executed on the current platform. 
Some examples are present in the scripts directory.
