         The GAMESS-UK Distribution Version 8.0 - Documentation
         ======================================================


NB:  Up-to-date documentation can always be obtained from the GAMESS-UK
     website at:

     http://www.cfs.dl.ac.uk/docs/index.shtml


This is the documentation directory of the GAMESS-UK distribution.

The documentation is maintained and distributed as latex files, with a
separate file for each directory. The latex files are the files in
this directory with the .tex suffix. To process the latex files you
will need the basic latex programs. Details on how to obtain these can
be found at:

http://www.latex-project.org/

Once you have installed latex, there are three scripts to convert the
latex files into more friendly formats for reading and printing. These
are:

gener_html_all
--------------
This script converts the latex to html. The html files will be created
in a subdirectory of this directory which will be named: gamess8.0_html

The html documentation can then be accessed by pointing your browser at the
file "index.html" that resides in this directory.

To convert the latex to html, you will need to have the latex2html
perl script installed on your system. This is available from:

http://www.latex2html.org/

Once you have installed this, please edit the gener_html_all script to
set the variables: LATEX2HTML and LATEX2HTML_DIR

By default, the gener_html_all script will create html for all the
chapters in the manual. However, if given a list of arguments (numbers
for the numbered chapters (e.g 3 for part 3) and the name for the named
chapters (e.g. mopac for the mopac chapter), it will only process
those chapters.

gener_pdf_all
-------------
This script converts the latex to pdf format. The pdf files will be created
in a subdirectory of this directory which will be named: gamess8.0_pdf

To convert the latex to pdf you will need the pdflatex program
installed on your system. This is available from:

http://www.pdftex.org 

Please ensure the pdflatex program is in your path or set the PDFLATEX
variable in the script accordingly.

gener_ps_all
------------
This script converts the latex to postscript format suitable for
printing. The postscript files will be created in a subdirectory of
this directory which will be named: gamess8.0_ps
