Changes introduced in GAMESS-UK Version 7.0 (February 2006)
===========================================================

Changes to the functionality of the code

   1. Fermi-dirac smearing implemented

      Normally orbitals are filled according to a step function, but
      this can cause convergence problems if it is uncertain which
      state to converge on. Fermi smearing allows orbitals to be
      partially filled, which can improve convergence in some
      problematic cases.

   2. Atomic Guess extended

      It is now possible to specify the per-atom electron
      configuration or charge for the atomic guess. It is also
      possible to specify alpha and beta populations for atoms in UHF
      calculations.

   3. Update of the Graphics Module

      The graphics modules have been revised to enable both density
      and potential codes to drive through full (s,p,d,f,g) basis
      sets.

   4. User-defined convergence schemes:

      It is now possible for a user to specify a particular
      convergence scheme, rather than the default one within
      GAMESS-UK. This is activated by placing the convergence criteria
      within a block in the input file delimited by the keywords
      newscf and end, following the specification of the runtype.

      This functionality is available in serial and within the
      parallel MPI ScaLAPACK driver.

   5. Changes to the DFT Module

          * New DFT Functionals

            Several new functionals have been added:
                o PBE exchange-correlation functional
                o HCTH120, HCTH147, HCTH407, KT1 and KT2 functionals.
                o PW92 local correlation functional
                o PW91 exchange, correlation and exchange-correlation functionals.
                o B95 meta-GGA correlation functional.
                o BB95, B1B95 and BB1K meta-GGA functionals.

                  NB - for the meta-GGA functionals, only the energies
                  and gradients can be calculated - the second
                  derivatives of the energy are not available.

          * More flexible DFT grid specifications

            The atom size is used in a number of tests within in the
            DFT code. Previously the same size was used for all tests,
            however it is now possible to specify the atomic size for
            each test separately, as shown in the examples below:

               1. The atomic radii for the angular grid pruning schemes: pradii 3.0
               2. The atomic size adjustment radii for the weighting scheme: wradii 3.0
               3. The screening radius: sradii 3.0
               4. The radial grid scale factor: radii 3.0 

            It is also now possible to specify the grid size for a row
            of the periodic table - previously this had to be done on
            a per-element basis. For example, to specify the grid size
            for the Lebedev-Laikov angular grid for the first row of
            the periodic table:

            lebedev row 1 194 

   6. Changes to the Post-HF Modules

          * The 255 basis function limit in the MRDCI code has been removed, 
            so that the code is effecively open-ended in the number of basis
            basis functions permitted.

          * Configuration Interaction Transformation between AO and MO
            basis' has been extended to g functions.

          * A facility to allow the punching of both transformed
            integrals and CI coefficients from the full CI code has
            been introduced. This uses (i) the cards directive, and
            (ii) an extension of the current print facility within the
            Full CI module. Thus the data file:

    core 10000000
    title
    h2co - 3-21g basis - valence full-ci
    super off nosym
    cards trans fullci
    zmatrix angstrom
    c
    o 1 1.203
    h 1 1.099 2 121.8
    h 1 1.099 2 121.8 3 180.0
    end
    active\5 to 22 end\core\1 to 4\end
    runtype ci\fullci 18 4 4
    punch 1 -8
    enter

            Would result in a complete list of transformed 1e- and
            2e-integrals to the file moints.ascii and all ci
            coefficients (greater than 1 x 10-8) to the file
            civecs.ascii.

          * The filenames for the files use in CI calculations can now
            be set through file directives in the input file as well
            as environment variables.

          * MR-ACPF (Multireference Averaged Coupled-Pair-Functional),
            MR-AQCC (Multi-Reference Average Quadratic
            Coupled-Cluster) and the CEPA0 coupled electron-pair
            approximation methods have been added to the MRDCI
            module. 

   7. The use of the HARMONIC directive has been extended to the
      Valence Bond code, allowing spherical harmonic basis sets to be
      used for d, f and g functions.

   8. A simple solvation model has been implemented in the Valence
      Bond code.

   9. Arbitrary (not spinadapted) wavefunctions are now possible in
      the Valence Bond code.

  10. The Valence Bond module can be compiled with 8-byte integers.

  11. The RESTORE option has been added to the ZORA module to allow
      zora relativistic (atomic) corrections to be stored and restored
      on the current and foreign dumpfile. This permits easy restart
      calculations, when the ZORA corrections do not need to be
      recalculated.

  12. New distributed data MPI HF/DFT driver

      A distributed-data HF and DFT module has been developed using
      MPI-based tools such as ScaLAPACK. All data structures, except
      those required for the Fock build are fully distributed. The
      functionality of this code is currently limited to closed shell
      and unrestricted open shell. To build this code BLACS and
      ScaLAPACK ( available from www.netlib.org ), must be installed
      on the target machine and the mpi build option selected when
      configuring the code.

  13. Taskfarming Harness

      A taskfarming harness has been developed. This is an MPI program
      designed to be run on a large number of processors on a parallel
      machine and 'batch processes' numerous small GAMESS-UK jobs. The
      taskfarming harness is currently only available as a separate
      binary of the mpi build of the code and is selected by choosing
      the taskfarm keyword when configuring the mpi code.


Changes to the structure of the code

   1. New Ports The code has been ported to several new platforms:

          * Macintosh OSX (G3, G4, and G5 processors)
          * Windows XP
          * AMD Opteron and Athlon processors running Linux.
          * Intel Xeon, EM64T and Itanium processors running Linux.
          * HP-UX running on Itanium processors.
          * Sunfire v880 server
          * SGI Altix
          * Cray XD1 

   2. Global Arrays

      The version of the Global Arrays supplied with GAMESS-UK has
      been updated from 3.3 to GA 3.4b.

   3. MOPAC

      The MOPAC code within GAMESS-UK has been updated to version 7.0

   4. Configuring GAMESS-UK

      A new configure process has been developed to ease porting the
      code to new platforms and making it easier for users to
      configure the build on their own machine. All platform-specific
      variables for the make process are stored in a file with an .mk
      suffix in the GAMESS-UK-7.0/config directory and the
      configuration process is run by the configure script in the main
      GAMESS-UK-7.0 directory. There are further notes in the file:
      GAMESS-UK-7.0/INSTALL.

   5. Testing the parallel code

      A new testing regieme has been developed for the parallel
      code. The testing regime is designed for users of the code who
      build from source and want to ensure that the code is
      functioning correctly. The test cases and README's explaining
      how to run the cases can be found in the directories:

      GAMESS-UK-7.0/examples/parallel\_GAs

      for the Global Array-based code and:

      GAMESS-UK-7.0/examples/parallel\_MPI

      for the new MPI HF/DFT module.


Peripheral Changes

   1. Demo Binaries

      Free Windows, Macintosh and Linux demo versions are available
      for users who wish to try out the code.

   2. GAMESS-UK Forum

      A GAMESS-UK Forum has been added to the Distributed Computing
      forums run at Daresbury. You can find the Forum at:

      www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/disco/index.shtml

      Please use the forum to ask any general questions you may have
      about GAMESS-UK or to solicit tips from the developers and other
      users on the best way to run GAMESS-UK.

   3. Changes to the website

      The website has been updated and moved to a new url and a
      Bugzilla facility for logging and querying bugs with the code
      has also been added.

      The new URL for the main GAMESS-UK website is:

      www.cfs.dl.ac.uk

      And the URL for the database of known bugs in the code is:

      www.cfs.dl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/bugzilla/index.cgi

   4. CCP1GUI

      The CCP1GUI is a free, extensible Graphical User Interface to
      various computational chemistry codes. Although it has
      interfaces to other codes such as Dalton and Mopac, the CCP1GUI
      has been developed around GAMESS-UK and provides a powerful tool
      for setting up and viewing the results of calculations with
      GAMESS-UK.

      The CCP1GUI is hosted on sourceforge at:

      http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccp1gui/

      The Python source code can be downloaded directly from
      Sourceforge, or there are packaged distributions of the CCP1GUI
      for different operating systems and architectures available via
      ftp from:

      ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui
