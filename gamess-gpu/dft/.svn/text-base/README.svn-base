          CCP1 DFT code - developmental version


1) Introduction
===============

This directory contains the source code and example input files
the CCP1 DFT project, as interfaced to GAMESS-UK.


2) User Documentation
=====================

The code is run by preparing a standard GAMESS-UK input deck, 
additional control directives beginning with the keyword `cdft'.

The following is a summary of the possible options.

cdft

  by itself (or with any of the following sub keywords) requests use of
  the ccpdft module. Available only for RHF, direct or conventional
  (rhfclm) SCF drivers.

cdft gauss ntheta

Select a Gauss-Legendre angular grid. ntheta is the number of theta
points requested. The total number of angular points per radial shell
is then ntheta*(ntheta*2)

cdft lebedev nang

  Select a Lebedev angular grid. nang is the number of angular points
  selected from 6,18,26,38,50,110,146,194,264,302,434.

cdft euler nrad
   
  Use nrad radial points per atom.


cdft jbas [ gamess | nwchem ]
....
end

  Enter fitting basis, nwchem or gamess-uk format. gamess is default.

cdft 4c2e  

  Request coulomb evaluation using 2e integrals

cdft hfex

  Request HF exchange instead of LDA

cdft lyp

  Request Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (default is VWN)

cdft b3lyp

  Request B3-LYP, (implemented as in nwchem)

cdft mix p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6  ...

  Request mixed functional. check meaning of parameters in 
  ccpdft.f77/interface/options_api.f routine CD_mix.
  At time of writing they are wghts for 
        HFex, Slater, VWN, VWNRPA, LYP, Becke88
  Becke88 here, and in b3lyp, excludes LDA part.

cdft nocorr 

  Request omission of correlation functional

cdft weight [ ssf ssfscr becke ]

  Choose weighting scheme. 
  becke   Modified Becke 
  ssf     Stratmann/Scuseria/Frisch from CPL v257 p213 (1996),
          including all atoms
  ssfscr  as above, but including only close atoms (defined using psi test
          below, if any function on the atom is significant at the nearest
          point on the current quadrature shell the atom is neighbour).
          This cannot be used unless screening is enabled.

cdft screen  [ psi psitol ] [ p dentol] [rho rhotol ]

  Switches on screening in XC integration
  psitol - determines whether a basis function is significant
           used in setup of atomic grids, determination of grid
           weights and computation of basis values at points
  dentol - determines if a density matrix element is significant
           when constructing density, gradient, hessian etc
  rhotol - is the total density value at a point large enough to 
           justify computing XC energy and KS matrix elements

  NB - screening is not yet exploited in the XC gradient code

cdft abort

    Stop after the first DFT energy/KS-matrix evaluation
    this also suppresses any 2-e integral exchange or correlation terms


3) Nature of coupling between ccpdft and GAMESS-UK.
===============================================

Host code capabilities

1) There are calls to ccpdft from the following stages of GAMESS-UK
  a) input directive processing
  b) system setup
  c) SCF (to get contributions to Fock matrix)
  d) fock matrix build (to provide control data)
  e) gradient driver
  f) 2-e derivative integral evaluation (to provide control data)

2) CCPDFT makes calls to GAMESS-UK routines to provide
  a) to dynamically allocate memory for use in DFT terms
  b) to store timing information within GAMESS-UK's internal tables

3) CCPDFT references common blocks from GAMESS-UK 
    !!!! some work to do here !!!!

4) API Definitions
==================

see the top part of interface.m for the current version of these
notes.


5) Descriptions of Approximations
=================================

Quadrature

    screening of atoms included

basis function calculation
    elimination of shells based on radial factors

density calculation
    check of density matrix elements


TO DO 
=====

lebe_sw, sg1_sw, are separate switches . but sg1 implies lebedev grids
  resolve?

Setup routines to be moved out of SCF to start of code

Print control to be passed into dft_control

Add some standard grid choices.

compute/Add missing radii for heavier elements

bas_val - fix memory allocation for hardwired arrays (500)

remove gamess commons from integ_ routines

find a way of passing time info back to gamess without using 
  include files

point  batch  size should be controlable to allow optimisatio
  and to save memory

sort out dependency on correct SCF driver (rhfclm, drhfcl)
  - flag error when entering rhfcld
