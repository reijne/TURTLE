Examples for GAMESS-UK Hands-on Sessions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following examples are taken from the GAMESS-UK presentations, and
are specified below as running under "rungamess". We provide the
appropriate headings corresponding to the material in the lectures.
Note that the complete set of examples for each session may be executed
using the scripts:

	run_em_all.session1  and run_em_all.session2

Executing the examples separately will require appropriate modifications
to the file set_environment, and subsequently:

        source set_environment

It is assumed that these examples are run by the user while working
through the session lectures, with the presentation material available
at URL
