Running the Parallel GA-based Examples and Validation tests
-----------------------------------------------------------

This directory is designed for use in running the validation and
benchmark jobs associated with the Global Array (GA) based parallel
GAMESS-UK code. The overall directory structure for GAMESS-UK depicting
the various components employed is shown below:

The directories under parallel_GAs serve the following purpose:

input_files  - a single copy of the .in files for use across all
	       machines. These hold the minimal set used for
	       validation, and are intended to characterise 
               simple use of the code. These files should be common to
	       all machines, with a minimum of pre-directives.

input_files_benchmarks - a single copy of all the benchmark input
	       files for use across all machines - these will contain
	       redirectives for e.g. holding the dumpfile and
	       scratchfile in GAs, using select/thresh to minimise run
	       time etc.

test_jobs   - this directory contains the vtab file for the runs - this
	      file should be used on ALL machines. Within test_jobs
	      there are a no. of sub-directories that characterise the
	      machine under test. These will only hold scripts to run
	      the validation jobs, and eventually O/P files from the
	      completed tests.

benchmark_jobs - similar to test_jobs above, with machine specific
              scripts to run the more extensive benchmark tests.

Thus to test and validate the code on a given machine, simply head for
examples/parallel_GAs/test_jobs/machine [where machine = hpcx, origin,
altix etc] and run the example scripts and validation tests provided.
The latter scripts are intended to help in this process and should be
modified as appropriate to run the 30 odd cases required for successful
validation.  Many of these tests are short - between them they test out
all the key functionality in the parallel code. A mixture of 32 and 64
CPU runs required about 1 hour 15 minutes on HPCx.
