Running the Parallel GA-based Examples and Validation tests
-----------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains various subdirectories for validating the
code. The examples should be run in a subdirectory of test_jobs.

The script runall_example.sh is an example submission script that you
can use as a basis for creating your own script if your machine /
queueing sustem is not already supported.

To do this create a directory in the "test_jobs" directory named after
your machine, copy the script to this directory and edit it as
necessary. Comments in the script should help you set up your own
version. You should ensure that all the *.out output files end up back
in this directory.

Once you have run all the jobs, the script validate.sh in the
test_jobs directory can be used to validate the outputs. The script
takes a single argument, which is the name of the directory to
validate.

For example, if you have run your jobs in the directory:

/home/me/GAMESS-UK/examples/parallel_GAs/test_jobs/mydirectory

and the *.out files are sat there, cd up one directory to:

/home/me/GAMESS-UK/examples/parallel_GAs/test_jobs

and then run validate.sh from there as follows:

./validate.sh ./mydirectory
