Problem cases for CCP1 DFT module

testfit1_dga2 : DGauss A2 fitting for water
---------------
Problem is that the energy/coefficients and most markedly the 2 components of
the coulomb gradient (the 2 centre and  3 centre parts) differ from nwchem.
See also testfit1_dga2.nw (NWChem job) and dftg_cdfit.F (modified NWChem routine
to write out data for comparison).

testsp:  SP basis sets used in coulomb fit.
-------
Initial problem is in the 1 centre integrals - may be more to 
follow.

h2o_lda_mpole
-------------
Still needs work on this module. May run on SP2, to be confirmed.
