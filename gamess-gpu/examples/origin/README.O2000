Validation Examples for Origin 2000
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These examples are taken from the chapter 16 of the GAMESS-UK manual,
and are assumed to be run interactively, and not under qsub control.
Two run scripts are provided, run_examples_init and run_examples_final,
both invoking the "run1" script for processing a number of separate
examples. Note that run1 will, as configured, check whether the
associated output data set is resident in the LOGS directory, and will
validate the output against known data. Each example will only be run
if the validation process is not successful.

Note that these examples are from an 8-processor Origin 2000 at the
University of Durham (U.K). Running on a different system will require
changes to the gamess.p configuration file, as described in Part 16
of the User Manual.

1. run_examples_init; this should be run first, and will conduct an
   =================  initial somewhat primitive validation of the code 
based on the following example data sets. The gamess.p configuration file 
should specify two processors i.e.

gamess hamilton  2 /usr/local/GAMESS/GAMESS-UK/bin/gamess-uk /xlv1/GAMESS

h2co_secd               h2co tzvp basis direct SCF 2nd derivatives

2. run_examples_final; this provides more extensive validation of the
   ==================  code, based on the following examples. The gamess.p 
configuration file should specify 4 or more processors e.g.

gamess hamilton  6 /usr/local/GAMESS/GAMESS-UK/bin/gamess-uk /xlv1/GAMESS
