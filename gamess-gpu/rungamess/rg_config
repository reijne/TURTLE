echo Ensure the following environment variables are set
echo
echo The executable name is taken from the environment variable GAMESS_EXE.
echo 
echo The environment variable GAMESS_SCR must be set to the name of a
echo directory in which the user has permission to create files. A
echo directory will be created under this directory for each job that is
echo run, and all binary datasets that are not routed elsewhere will be
echo written here for the duration of the job. The directory is deleted at
echo the end of the job. If GAMESS_SCR does not exist, an attempt will be
echo made to create it. 
echo 
echo The environment variable GAMESS_TMP should be set to a directory in
echo which storage of files between jobs is possible.
echo 
echo The environment variable GAMESS_LIB must be set to the name of a
echo directory containing the GAMESS-UK Library files \(typically of the
echo form ../GAMESS-UK/libs in the current distribution\).
echo
echo Note that if you wish to use the host as a server for running 
echo GAMESS-UK jobs from another host, be sure to place these settings
echo in the .cshrc file rather than .login, so that they will be 
echo available even under a rsh \(rather than a rlogin\) process.
