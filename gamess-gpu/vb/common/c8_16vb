c... common to  sitmch from 8 to 16 bits orb ital packing
c...  n8_16 is # bits used for packing; i.e. 8 (255 orbitals) 16 (32000)
c...  n16_32 is the correspnding one for 16 vs 32 bits packin 
c...  GAMESS  parameters cannot be used as VB may have more MO's than AO's
c...  parameters are set in vbcrestr
