This file only applies at PNL.



This file describes what is included here for those intending to make
changes to PeIGS. Let $(PEIGSDIR) denote the path of the PeIGS
directory.

The PeIGS code is maintained using CVS.  To get the latest
revision and development version

do the following:

% setenv CVSROOT /msrc/apps/hpctools/src/peigs/peigs_sty

go into your favorite working directory

%cvs checkout peigs1.0

CVS will extract the latested "committed" source code after the
release version 1.0.  We keep duplicate copies of various released
versions in compressed tar format in the directory
/afs/msrc.pnl.gov/files/home/d3g270/spare1/PEIG_STY/peigs###.tar.Z on
the machines snacker.pnl.gov or on maddog.pnl.gov

More than 90% of the the code is written in C and are stored in
"$(PEIGSDIR)/src/c".  Fortran interface to the C codes are provided
and stored in the subdirectory "$(PEIGSDIR)/ctof".  Our C codes call
the double precision Fortran version of the BLAS library ( which is
stored in "$(PEIGSDIR)/src/blas" ).  We also call the double precision
version of the LAPACK library.  The LAPACK codes are stored in
"$(PEIGSDIR)/src/lapack".

The INSTALL file in the top level PeIGS files tells you how to install
the files and the test_la files can be used to perform regression tests
on your code.
