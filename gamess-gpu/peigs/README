README file for PeIGS.

The package, PeIGS, is a collection of linear algebra programs for
solving the general and standard symmetric eigensystem problem.  It is
being developed at Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
operated by Battelle Memorial Institute and is in the Public Domain.  The
authors are David Elwood, George Fann, and Richard Littlefield.

There is a separate test directory "test_la" which performs a suite of
tests comparing the accuracy of this code with serial versions of
LAPACK and LINPACK.  This test suite also contains test codes for
random distribution of data.

For installation instructions please read the file "INSTALL."

The source code are contained in the directory "src/#" where #
is the programming language.

This is the top level directory for the general eigensystem solver Ax
= \lambda B x for a symmetric matrix A and a symmetric positive
definite matrix B.

The documentation is contained in ./doc/peigs.texi.  This is a file
which can be converted to a dvi file using texi2dvi, a GNU product.
It is also readable as on-line documentation using emacs using the
texi mode.

This is a very brief summary of what is contained in src/c The user is
advised to look at peigs.texi before installation.
