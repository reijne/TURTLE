                        Global Arrays on Windows NT

Requirements
------------

This code requires an implementation of MPI that works on a single PC.
It was tested with WMPI, an NT implementation derived from MPICH
in Portugal. 

Compilers:

MS Power Fortran 4 or DEC Visual Fortran 5, 6
MS Visual C 4, 5, 6

Building GA
-----------

To build the GA software, you need to do

1. Select Environemt tab under System ( & Advanced on w2k) from Control Panel.
2. Set two environment variables (described in the Unix documentation for GA)
   that point to a location of MPI, for example for WMPI on disk D:

   set MPI_INCLUDE as d:\Wmpi\Include 
   set MPI_LIB as d:\Wmpi\Console 

3. Make sure that the dynamic link libraries required by the particular
   implementation of MPI is copied to the appropriate location for
   the system DLLs. For WMPI, copy VWMPI.dll to \winnt

4. In the top directory do,

   nmake

The GA test.exe program can be built in g\global\testing directory:

   nmake test.exe

The GA programs are run as any other MPI application. For, WMPI you need
to create the .pg file.

Example:

R:\nt\g\global\testing> start /b test.exe


Addtional Notes
---------------

You can make this code on Windows 95. However, due to the DOS shell
limitations, the top level NTmakefile will not work. Therefore, each 
library has to be made separately in its own directory. The environment
variables referring to MPI can be hardcoded in NT makefiles.
