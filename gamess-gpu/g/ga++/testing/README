                   The GA++ Test Programs

These programs can be built after the GA library is compiled.
To build C and Fortran programs type:
"make testc.x"     to create a test program for GA
"make ntestc.x"    to create a test program for n-dim GA
"make mtest.x"     To create a test program for matrix functions
"make elempatch.x" To create a test program for the  element-wise 
		   functions 
"make testmult.x"  To create a test program for dgemm,sgemm,zgemm, 
		   nga_matmul_patch
