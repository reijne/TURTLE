cd to gamess directory
type: ./configure

and select the compiler options (I usually make the parallel, large version with i8; I used the following options:
pgi parallel ga mpi ci dl-find vdw masscf mpiwrap i8 vb zora large))

then type make; that should work

2 bottlenecks in the code:

1) in vbmatre.m, in the routine matre3, subroutine gwmix
(a profiler would probably point to the function intpos, which calculates integral addresses)
The original code in gamess-cpu uses the routine gmix, I rewrote gwmix to port it to the GPU

2) 4-index transformation in vbtran.m (but this is not the main bottleneck)
